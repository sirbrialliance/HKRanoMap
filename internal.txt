
slot 2: defaults
slot 3: c-area + more item rando
slot 4: area + "everything" (and a shade)

Next
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Randomizer 4
	- all the data has been rearranged
		- item locations
		- transitions
		- "allItemPools"
		- itemPlacements needs to have array values
			- getItemAt() too
			- this.items get populated

		- Are the final item locatoins only in ItemSpoilerLog.json, or can I just grab them from the ItemChanger?
			- ItemChanger save data is a bit more obtuse and includes things like "if you have A, then item is A + 1"

		- also for transitions from TransitionSpoilerLog.json?
		- transistion log still good? If not may have data in TrackerDataPM.txt


		- where did the "intended route" data go? Can I get it from TrackerData class?
			- Is the id on RandomizerMod.IC.RandoPlacementTag, RandomizerMod relevant?
			- Or do I have to open up spoiler log stuffs instead?

	- non-bidi transitions mess up island generation





- Do a release?
	- Collected items don't appear right on new saves until you've saved and refreshed the page

	- get stags working right
	- more visible player room
	- Crossroads_01 has a bench?!

	- have to refresh for shade search
	- item search shows irrelevant items as not gotten
	- taking elevator/etc. doesn't mark transition as visited

	- update readme
	- update version

- look into framerate
	- nn Firefox is faster than Chromium, item icons+filter and cross-island links make it worse
	- either ignore it or three.js, probably

- @routing 2.0
	- pathing
		- get stag working right
		- options
			- benchwarp (off, discovered, all (spoilers))
			- dream warp
			- avoid room list
		- text description of calculated route
			- push to in-game HUD?
				- option to show/hide/where
		- fix path rendering when there's multiple paths between two rooms (e.g. Deepnest_01b and Deepnest_02 no room rando)

	- test non/area/room rando works
		- do visited rooms/transitions get recorded?
	- view layout that linearizes your selected route

	- double-check split room door ids: Hive_01
	- needs to know what side has bench Hive_01, Ruins1_18
	- Ruins2_03 doens't show the grub? Or, it's on the wrong side?


- Item viewing
	- show all items near mouse, in some cases v close or on top of each other
		- also, shops
	- show what an item is if we've gotten it
		- record what an item is if we get near it but don't collect it? e.g. essence trees?
		- replace the rotated square with a letter or icon once you know (maybe hotload the .pngs from the Randomizer mod)
	- test item view set to "relevant"
		- do irrelevant items still get recorded?
	- live update item state when you get them

Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- select shade room on death (if no selection)

- use randomizer's logic when planning routes


- zoom at least x amount when framing a room
- arrow keys+enter for search box

- icons for rooms
- mark shade room
	- PlayerData.instance.shadeScene
- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms
- stronger relative positions next to user's room
- things that aren't "close" to our current room shouldn't appear close visually

- search rooms by icon

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- Room position stability:
	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- stay close to src room if dead end
	- align with doors instead of centers

- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- Spoilers: give hint
	- See: JSON.parse(data.saveData.PolymorphicModData.RandomizerMod).StringValues._orderedLocations
	- next in progression or specific item, save given hints to a log

- Button to select a nearby room with unvisited transition

- travel history?


- pathfind to nearest mark of given type

- based on route, could show an in-game arrow pointing to the target transition in question

- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- maybe show where you are and your target is, if offscreen (little this-a-way arrows)

- goals/stats
	- collapsible box
	- Stats summary
		- dreamer status
		- pantheon/boss status summary
		- # of mask shards, grimm flames, grubs, essencecharm notch, ore, vessel fragments, charms, stags
		- geo and geo in relics (and geo spend?)
		- key abilities (focus, nail, dash, spells, etc)
		- "randomizer percent" (num checks/cleared checks)
	- checkboxes for common goals: any%, grubs, pantheon, 112%, moth evaportaion
	- show status toward each goal (e.g. 5/46 grubs, 2/3 dreamers, boss count and which you do/don't have)
	- "give hint" button skips things that aren't in your goals
	- show rando seed (and settings?)


- "balance" section
	- options:
		- only show completion stats with world sense
		- enable/disable room routing (off/auto/on, auto enables for room rando)
		- In-game maps reveal info
			- Show grub locations when you have the collector's map (or unveil item data)
			- Area maps: show all rooms for area, and transitions between rooms that we have maps for)
				- or maybe just reveal 40% of nearby rooms if room rando (Conifer's maps don't start complete)
			- bonus: show where you are in a room when you have wayward compass equipped
		- grub map reveals grub items
		- Jiji hint egg gives real hints

- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
		- "try using the On.UIManager.StartNewGame hook rather than the ModHooks hook"
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings

- User feedback:
	- xx forgot dependency for websockets
	- hit the new save file bug
	- xx found it to kill game performance on another monitor (likely multi-GPU buffer copy)
	- make dragged rooms stay where dragged a lot better
	- xx connections hard to see with long room names in the way (and maybe make room connections have dark "inside" inside the broader white outline)
	- color transitions based on logic (if it can be taken with the current loadout)
	- performance issues when rendering in cluster layout (perhaps push cluster motion (and DOM update plans?) to web workers)
	- xx when selecting a room, ability to zoom to it, or message that you haven't seen it
	- map wiggling bug
	- make it easier to find yourself
	- probably should make hub & distance the default view
	- show benches w/Benchwap mod names
	- ** "where am I?"
	- ** "it's lagging my computer" "this is pretty awful" - enough so I can see the framerate drop at 2x speed...
	- xx Confusion from elevators not being linked
	- somehow map stopped recording new transitions? Might be because they were reloading the map and the save data is stale bug.
	- room <-> bench routing
	- room icons
	- room search:
		- only show visible rooms in dropdown (but maybe we just make it easy to see in selection)
		- name search
