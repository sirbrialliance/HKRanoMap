Next
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- mega revamp
	- xx trim trailing whitespace

	- compile data
		- xx with all base transitions
		- xx with thumbnail dimensions
		- regen
	- start rendering something

	- live check indicators:
		- xx not a late enough LateUpdate, lags behind camera pos a bit
		- zz directional arrorw pointing, unless resting on the object
		- zz kinda a bit too hand-holdy?
			- maybe make a little radar instead of putting direction arrows all oaver the screen.
		- xx make cleared semi transparent

		- handle one-way doors
		- test with not all item types randomized
		- show shade?
		- could add anotother icon/color/target for pathing the user
		- items stacking on shopkeepers
		- maybe have different random margin offsets per axis



	- Better handling of things on top of each other? (Maybe just give every arrow a slightly different margin)
	- auto-reveal geo/grub (or secret fake)/soul world items if oyu are close enough
		- set to previewed if in camera view frustum for 500ms
	- state icons: eye, lock, checkmark, ??
	- hide added HUD stuff during boss/miniboss fights
	- may need to seperate my "previews" from logic previews. e.g. grub vs. mimic. "geo rock", but is it 15 geo? 420 geo?
	- maybe indicate when you enter a room you shouldn't be able to get to?
	- maybe a list with the map of previewed items and their locations, most important first
		- maybe importance = number of times there's a logic condition that requires it

- Data issues:
	- "Couldn't find item location Boss_Essence-Gorb"
	- Bretta doesn't appear as a check/task...but neither do levers...
		- White palace entrance
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Boss_Essence-Gorb
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Boss_Essence-Grey_Prince_Zote
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Boss_Essence-Xero
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Lore_Tablet-World_Sense
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Nailmaster's_Glory
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Unknown room Cinematic_Stag_travel
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Unknown room Dream_Final
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Unknown room Dream_Final
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Unknown room Cinematic_Ending_C
	- Colosseum rewards
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Boss_Essence-Soul_Tyrant
	- [WARN]:[TangledMapViewMod] - Couldn't find item location Lurien
	- Somehow got Geo_Rock-Ancestral_Mound or Geo_Rock-Ancestral_Mound_Dupe to stay marked as uncollected onscreen...maybe because both rock might have burst the same frame?
		- No...the rock higher up was actually the item we were tracking? Ancestral_Mound_Tree(_Dupe)? Bad position data?


- docs
	- Live icons: "They help you determine if you need to learn something new, come back later, or git gud."


- things:
	- show number of new checks accessible when you grab an item (that unlocks things)
	- show arrows/markers to all undiscovered checks in room
		- and doors
	- show logic for a given check and which conditions are true
	- update visuals when get item
	- works right with new game or loaded game
	- shade location
	- maybe distinguish between previewed junk and progression items
	- "xxyy transitions/locations became available" when you get something
	- Spoilers: Off, Off (strict), Thematic, Truly Thematic, Casual, On
		- Strict disables auto-preview
		- Thematic reaveals information based on in-game informatoin items (e.g. area maps reveals corrosponding rooms and outgoing transitions between mapped rooms), grub map reveals grub locations
		- Truly Thematic only updates the map once you find the quill, reveals rooms from maps you find.
		- Casual allows buying hints
		- On just shows everything
	- Maybe have live view option
		- that's "memory only" - only indicates what you've done, what what you could/can't do
		- that only shows the markers when you're focusing soul - might be a good default
	- Unrandomized transitinos:
		- Mabe just record the transitions oyu visit that aren't randomized?
		- Or perhaps just use a different icon for unrandomized transitions: Maybe just a gray "=" icon. Or red if unchanged and unreachable.
	- Maybe always sort items by name since some things will render on top of others.

- need a tracker
	- grub and other currency count
		- include depositied rancid eggs
		- dream essence, even if we don't have the nail

	- dreamer count
	- keys


- ItemChanger + benchwarp and no preload - try warp:
	NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  at ItemChanger.StartDef+<OnRespawn>d__38.MoveNext () [0x0021c] in C:\dev\ItemChanger\ItemChanger\StartDef.cs:167
  at UnityEngine.SetupCoroutine.InvokeMoveNext (System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator, System.IntPtr returnValueAddress) [0x00026] in <047294ce45cf4b9a9441e48d2b8435e4>:0
- Geo_Rock-Mantis_Outskirts_Alcove, IMO, should require difficult skips when itemless, not just precise movement


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- map tiles
		- deal with black screen during bench wake up
		- thumbs don't get the LUT
		- can't see acid and sometimes other level details
		- some way to deal with the massive useless margins
			- automated GIMP filter?

		- maybe put a bunch of successive backplanes in so it looks like fog?


- Issues
	- Collected items don't appear right on new saves until you've saved and refreshed the page
	- more visible player room
	- have to refresh for shade search (push updates to save data to browser)
	- item search shows irrelevant items as not gotten
	- taking elevator/etc. doesn't mark transition as visited

- routing 2.0
	- get stag working right
	- options
		- benchwarp (off, discovered, all (spoilers))
		- dream warp
		- avoid room list?
	- text description of calculated route
		- push to in-game HUD
			- option to show/hide/where?
	- fix path rendering (animated glow) when there's multiple paths between two rooms (e.g. Deepnest_01b and Deepnest_02 no room rando)
	- view layout that linearizes your selected route

- data issues:
	- split room door ids on Hive_01 are wrong
	- needs to know what side has bench Hive_01, Ruins1_18
	- Ruins2_03 doens't show the grub? Or, it's on the wrong side?
	- Crossroads_01 "has a bench"

- Item viewing
	- show all items near mouse, in some cases v close or on top of each other
		- also, shops
	- test item view set to "relevant"
		- do irrelevant items still get recorded?
	- do something with the flickering when hovering over a room near the bottom of the screen?


- look into framerate
	- nn Firefox is faster than Chromium, item icons+filter and cross-island links make it worse
	- either ignore it or three.js, probably

- just show irrelevant items as irrelevant, never mind if you got it or not
	- own icon, can see if you select the view option

- names: "Mimic Room", Midwife
- add benches in trams...somehow?
- show if room has bench in room hover or give bench a more visible icon

- unmatched transitions?

- select shade room on death (if no selection)

- collapsible settings menus

- use randomizer's logic when planning routes


- zoom at least x amount when framing a room
- arrow keys+enter for search box

- icons for rooms
- mark shade room
	- PlayerData.instance.shadeScene
- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms
- stronger relative positions next to user's room
- things that aren't "close" to our current room shouldn't appear close visually

- search rooms by icon

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- Room position stability:
	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- stay close to src room if dead end
	- align with doors instead of centers

- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- Spoilers: give hint
	- See: JSON.parse(data.saveData.PolymorphicModData.RandomizerMod).StringValues._orderedLocations
	- next in progression or specific item, save given hints to a log

- Button to select a nearby room with unvisited transition

- travel history?


- pathfind to nearest mark of given type

- based on route, could show an in-game arrow pointing to the target transition in question

- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- record what an item is if we get near it but don't collect it? e.g. essence trees?
	- replace the rotated square with a letter or icon once you know (maybe hotload the .pngs from the Randomizer mod)

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- maybe show where you are and your target is, if offscreen (little this-a-way arrows)

- goals/stats
	- collapsible box
	- Stats summary
		- dreamer status
		- pantheon/boss status summary
		- # of mask shards, grimm flames, grubs, essencecharm notch, ore, vessel fragments, charms, stags
		- geo and geo in relics (and geo spend?)
		- key abilities (focus, nail, dash, spells, etc)
		- "randomizer percent" (num checks/cleared checks)
	- checkboxes for common goals: any%, grubs, pantheon, 112%, moth evaportaion
	- show status toward each goal (e.g. 5/46 grubs, 2/3 dreamers, boss count and which you do/don't have)
	- "give hint" button skips things that aren't in your goals
	- show rando seed (and settings?)


- "balance" section
	- options:
		- only show completion stats with world sense
		- enable/disable room routing (off/auto/on, auto enables for room rando)
		- In-game maps reveal info
			- Show grub locations when you have the collector's map (or unveil item data)
			- Area maps: show all rooms for area, and transitions between rooms that we have maps for)
				- or maybe just reveal 40% of nearby rooms if room rando (Cornifer's maps don't start complete)
			- bonus: show where you are in a room when you have wayward compass equipped
		- grub map reveals grub items
		- Jiji hint egg gives real hints
		- Wayward compass shows where in a room you are on the map

- randomizer area vs Cornifer area

- click a door to jump to linked room
- disable long connect lines when things get slow?

Wishes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- User feedback:
	- old/handled
		- xx hit the new save file bug
		- xx forgot dependency for websockets
		- xx found it to kill game performance on another monitor (likely multi-GPU buffer copy)
		- xx connections hard to see with long room names in the way (and maybe make room connections have dark "inside" inside the broader white outline)
		- xx when selecting a room, ability to zoom to it, or message that you haven't seen it
		- xx "it's lagging my computer" "this is pretty awful" - enough so I can see the framerate drop at 2x speed...
		- xx Confusion from elevators not being linked
		- zz somehow map stopped recording new transitions? Might be because they were reloading the map and the save data is stale bug.
		- xx room search:
			- only show visible rooms in dropdown (but maybe we just make it easy to see in selection)
			- name search

	- make dragged rooms stay where dragged a lot better
	- color transitions based on logic (if it can be taken with the current loadout)
	- performance issues when rendering in cluster layout (perhaps push cluster motion (and DOM update plans?) to web workers)
	- map wiggling bug
	- make it easier to find yourself "where am I?"
	- probably should make hub & distance the default view
	- show benches w/Benchwap mod names
	- room <-> bench routing
	- add room icons/annotation

	- hard to see bench, show if has bench in room hover
	- support for HK 1.5 + Randomizer 4?
	- unmatched transitions?
	- rooms start far apart

	- use better map icons (Cornifer icons)
	- assorted room metadata feedback
